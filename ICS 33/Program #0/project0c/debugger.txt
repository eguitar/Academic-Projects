Programming Assignment #0, Part C

Run the craps program controlled by the Debugger Perspective as specified in the
programming assignment, to answer each the following questions. When asked to
show dice "throws" each throw is the sum of the two dice values, not the values
of the individual dice. So in 2 and 6, if the throws were 8 (4+4), 6(2+4), and
7(3+4), losing by not making the point 8, you would write just 8, 6, 7 (the
sums).


Answer each question briefly, with the required numbers (using no or few words).
When questions have multiple answers, separate your answers by semicolons.
